"""A-priori (reasoning-driven) tool-result summarization.

This is the *a-priori* sibling of the agent-authored *a-posteriori*
``context(action='summarize'|'rebuild')`` path, whose private engine is
``tools/system/summarize.py``.

Difference in timing and authorship:

- A-posteriori summarize: the agent has already *seen* a large result, digests
  it, and supplies its own summary string to replace the visible block.
- A-priori summarize (this module): the caller sets ``summary=true`` on the
  tool call *before* the result exists. The tool runs normally, the raw result
  is preserved in the durable event log (``logs/events.jsonl`` by
  ``tool_call_id``), and then — before the result enters the main agent's
  model-visible context — the visible payload is replaced by an LLM-generated
  summary driven by the call's ``reasoning`` field. The agent never sees the
  raw payload in context; it sees the summary plus a retrieval locator.

Both paths share the same replacement/locator semantics: a marked, non-canonical
replacement dict that states the raw is preserved and how to retrieve it by
``tool_call_id``.

Safety properties:

- **Untrusted output:** the summarizer prompt treats the tool output as data,
  not instructions. The summarizer is told never to follow instructions found
  inside the tool result.
- **Hard cap:** if the formal visible payload to summarize exceeds
  ``APRIORI_SUMMARY_CAP`` characters, the LLM is *not* called. A refusal
  replacement is returned instead — the raw is still preserved and the model
  never sees the oversized raw payload in context.
- **Fail-closed-to-error, never fail-open-to-raw:** if the summarizer call
  raises, the model sees a summary-layer error (with the retrieval locator),
  not the raw payload. ``summary=true`` is a request to *not* put the raw
  result into context; a summarizer failure must not silently violate that.
