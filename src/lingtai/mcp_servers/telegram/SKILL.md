# Telegram MCP — usage manual (progressive disclosure)

This manual is pulled on demand via `action='manual'` so the per-action tool
schema can stay concise. Read it when you need detail beyond the one-line action
descriptions; you do not need to call it before every send.

Registration, `init.json` activation, config-file placement/permissions, and the
setup readiness checklist are **not** here — they belong to `mcp-manual`
(`reference/curated-addons.md`).

## MEDIA: document vs photo

- Charts, plots, reports, HTML/SVG/PNG/PDF exports, CSVs, and any other
  generated artifact the user should open intact: send with
  `media.type='document'`. Documents arrive as a downloadable file, uncropped
  and uncompressed.
- `media.type='photo'` is for native inline photo previews only. Telegram may
  crop, compress, thumbnail, or otherwise degrade text-heavy graphics sent as a
  photo, so a chart can look cropped or unreadable.
- Do not paste a local file path into message text as a substitute for
  attaching the file; attach it with `media={type, path}`.

## INBOUND MEDIA: reading what the user sends you

- When a user sends a photo or document, the message's `media` object includes
  an absolute local `path` to the downloaded attachment (under the agent's
  `telegram/<account>/inbox/<uuid>/attachments/` directory) plus
  `type`, `filename`, and `size`.
- Use the `vision` capability to read images: `vision(action='analyze',
  image_path=<absolute path>)`. Do not try to infer image content from the
  filename or size alone.
- If `media.view_with_vision` is present, the attachment is an image-like
  file and the manager explicitly suggests the vision route.
- If `media.download_error` is present, the download failed; the metadata is
  preserved without a path, so read the message text and ask the user to
  resend if the attachment matters.

## PLACEHOLDER / LIVE-STATUS

- For responses that take more than ~5s, send `action='send'` with
  `placeholder=true` (and your interim text, e.g. "Looking into that…").
  This fires a typing indicator and returns a compound `message_id`.
- Edit that **same** message at meaningful phase changes with `action='edit'`,
  `message_id=<that id>`, `text=<updated status>`. The user sees one evolving
  reply — not silence followed by a wall of text.
- The final answer must be a **separate durable message** using `action='send'`
  or `action='reply'`. Do **not** edit the placeholder into the final answer;
  the placeholder shows progress only (it may optionally be deleted).
- For very fast responses (under ~5s), native Telegram typing/👀 presence is
  enough — skip the placeholder.
- The Task Card is a separate surface from your placeholder. When the current
  agent has `taskcard: True`, the manager-owned automatic Task Card updates on
  its own; it is a mechanical view of recent `tool_call` events in
  `logs/events.jsonl`, not a turn-local heartbeat or completion lifecycle. See
  **AUTOMATIC TASK CARD** and **TASKCARD STATE** below.

## REPLY vs SEND

- `action='reply'` (`message_id` from read/check results, `text`) threads your
  response to a specific message and adds a ✅ reaction to it; prefer it when
  answering a particular incoming message.
- `action='send'` (`chat_id`, `text`) starts a fresh message in the chat; use it
  for unsolicited or standalone messages.

## READING: read / check / search

- `check`: list recent conversations with unread counts. Unread counts
  incoming messages only — your own outgoing replies are never counted.
- `read`: read messages from one chat (`chat_id`; optional `limit`). Reading
  marks messages read and clears the wake notification mirror.
- `search`: regex search over message text/sender/update type (`query`;
  optional `chat_id`, `account`).
- Every inbound record from `read`/`search` carries an additive `telegram`
  envelope: the complete raw Bot API Update (`update_id`, branch name, actor
  policy result, every nested/unknown field) plus, for edited messages, an
  append-only `edits` history of the raw edit events; `current_event_id`
  tracks the last-applied edit while `event_id` stays the immutable root
  event. Use it for selected-text
  reply quotes (`update.message.quote`), entities, forwards, topics, callback
  identity, etc. The concise top-level fields stay the quick view.
- Non-message updates (reactions, polls, member/boost/business events,
  inline-only callbacks, unknown future branches) land in the synthetic
  conversation bucket with `synthetic: true`; the raw event is in their
  `telegram` envelope. Pass `chat_id='updates'` (the one reserved
  non-numeric value the schema accepts) to `read`/`search` to recover them;
  `send`/`reply` still require a real numeric chat ID.

## RENDERING MODE: Markdown default for agent messages

- Content-bearing `send`, `reply`, and `edit` default to `rendering_mode='Markdown'`; the
  agent may omit it for agent messages. Choose exactly one of `plain_text`, `HTML`,
  `Markdown`, `MarkdownV2`, `entities`, or `rich` when needed. Internal manager-owned
  sends (such as progress/typing) still use the plain-text fallback when they omit it.
- `plain_text` maps to an omitted Bot API `parse_mode`; the other three named
  formats map to Telegram `parse_mode`. Choose it explicitly when no formatting is wanted.
- `entities` selects explicit `MessageEntity[]` formatting. Pass `entities` for
  message text or `caption_entities` for media captions; do not combine entity
  fields with a parse-mode rendering choice.
- `rich` sends a native Telegram Rich Message. Pass `structured_message`
  instead of `text` or `media`; its semantic fields are `title`, optional
  `summary`, `facts` (`label`/`value`), `bullets`, ordered `steps`, `code`
  (`text` plus optional `language`), `next` (`label`/`text`), and `footer`.
  The renderer maps those fields to native heading, paragraph, list,
  preformatted, divider, and footer blocks. Rich messages can also be used by
  `reply` and to edit a text/rich message, but not to edit a media caption.
- Rich-message expression is agent-directed, not a fixed decoration template.
  Use emoji as semantic signposts wherever they genuinely improve scanning —
  for example in a title, field label, or an occasional bullet. There is no
  hard count or title-only rule. Let message density and meaning decide; avoid
  repeating decorative emoji that add no information. Use facts for compact
  label/value emphasis, bullets for parallel ideas, and steps only for ordered
  actions. Ordinary conversational prose should remain ordinary text rather
  than being forced into a card.
- For `send` with only `chat_action` and no text/media, use `plain_text` because
  no message body is rendered. The public branch defaults to Markdown if the
  agent omits `rendering_mode`; internal manager-owned sends still use plain text.

## CHAT ACTION

- `chat_action` (`'typing'`, `'upload_photo'`, `'upload_document'`,
  `'upload_voice'`) on a send with no text/media sends just the indicator. It
  auto-expires after ~5s, so re-send periodically during long work. Pass `''`
  for no chat action.

## SLASH COMMANDS: dynamic Telegram menu entries

Telegram has two separate slash-command layers:

1. **Bot menu registration** (`setMyCommands`): what appears in Telegram's `/`
   command picker. The LingTai Telegram addon registers this menu at bot startup
   from each account's optional `commands` config list.
2. **Runtime handling**: what happens when a user sends the slash command. A
   small built-in set is handled locally by the addon without an LLM call
   (`/help`, `/status`, `/kanban`, `/system`, `/brief`, `/refresh`, `/sleep`,
   `/clear`, `/taskcard`). Other slash commands are not
   swallowed; they pass through as normal inbound messages for the host agent to
   answer or route.

To dynamically add a command such as `/tokenstats` to a bot's Telegram menu:

1. Edit the Telegram config file used by that agent (normally
   `<agent>/.secrets/telegram.json`, the path in `LINGTAI_TELEGRAM_CONFIG`).
2. Add or update the account's `commands` list. Command names are stored
   **without** the leading slash and should follow Telegram's Bot API
   constraints (lowercase letters, digits, underscores; 1-32 characters; short
   human-readable description):

   ```json
   {
     "accounts": [
       {
         "alias": "codex",
         "bot_token": "<secret>",
         "allowed_users": [6859932159],
         "commands": [
           {"command": "kanban", "description": "Show agent dashboard"},
           {"command": "tokenstats", "description": "Show recent token usage stats"}
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Run `system(action="refresh")` (or restart the agent). On startup the
   addon calls Telegram Bot API `setMyCommands` best-effort; failure is logged
   but does not block the bot.
4. Verify with the Telegram `/` picker or `lingtai://status` / `telegram.accounts`;
   status shows `commands_count` but never exposes the bot token.

Important behavior notes:

- The built-in commands use the channel-neutral local-command core for Agent
  filesystem reads, signal writes, and Task Card preference parsing. Telegram
  still owns actor admission, slash/callback dispatch, Markdown, emoji, inline
  keyboards, chat/message IDs, and Bot API delivery, so their visible output
  and behavior are unchanged.

- Adding a command to `commands` **only registers the menu entry**. It does not
  by itself create a local no-LLM implementation. For `/tokenstats`, either
  teach the host agent (via pad/skill/standing instructions) how to respond
  when it receives `/tokenstats`, or add a code-level local handler in
  `TelegramAccount._handle_slash_command()` if the command should be served
  without invoking the agent.
- If you include `commands: []`, the addon sends an empty list to
  `setMyCommands`, which clears the Telegram command menu for that account.
- If `commands` is omitted or `null`, the addon falls back to its built-in
  default command menu.
- Do not edit or print `bot_token` values while documenting or debugging slash
  commands. `lingtai://status` reports only a redacted, non-secret view.

## AGENT SWITCHING: default-off target-only routing

Agent switching is a per-account, default-off transport feature.

**Platform warning:** V1 automatic state-lock selection is enabled only when the
runtime identity is exactly `os.name == "posix"` and `sys.platform == "darwin"`
(macOS). Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, and every other host are unsupported. On an
unsupported host, leaving the feature disabled preserves normal Telegram startup;
explicitly enabling it makes eager manager construction fail closed before any
poller starts, and the MCP remains error-only until the setting is disabled or the
Bot is moved to a supported macOS host. Do not use the example below on an
unsupported host.

Enable it only with an explicit account setting:

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "alias": "main",
      "bot_token": "<secret>",
      "allowed_users": [12345678],
      "agent_switching": {"enabled": true}
    }
  ]
}
```

When enabled, admitted humans in a private chat can use these local controls:

- `@agent-name` persistently selects one eligible target for later ordinary
  text messages from the same account + chat + human.
- `@agent-name <text>` routes one non-empty plain-text message without changing
  the saved selection.
- Exactly `@` or `/agent` lists eligible targets; `/agent status` shows the
  current target and `/agent reset` returns later messages to the owner Agent.
- `/agent@BotUsername ...` is accepted only for this Bot. Command and selector
  tokens are delimited by Telegram/Python whitespace (spaces, tabs, or newlines);
  malformed `/agent...` prefixes fail locally, while ordinary selected-message
  bodies retain their exact text. Names use exact LingTai Agent names (ASCII
  letters, digits, `_`, `-`); there is no fuzzy or display-name matching.
- `/start`, `/start <args>`, and forms addressed to this Bot remain the normal
  owner/admin setup path even after callback or persistent target selection. The
  switching router does not answer, mutate selection, mint authority, or wake a
  target; the account's existing local setup handler supplies the normal response.
- If saved selection state is corrupt, unsafe, unavailable, or unreadable, ordinary
  messages fail locally with no owner/admin or target provider projection. `/agent
  status` reports the unavailable state. `/agent reset` clears it, and a valid bare
  selector such as `@agent-name` atomically replaces it; neither path revokes
  authority already delivered to a target.

The `/agent` BotCommand entry is composed only for enabled accounts. If
`commands` is omitted, the normal defaults plus `/agent` are registered. A
custom non-empty list gains `/agent` unless it already contains that command;
a configured description is preserved. Explicit `commands: []` remains an
explicit empty Telegram menu even though typed controls are still handled.

Routing is deliberately narrower than the public Telegram MCP:

- Only verified live direct or nested avatar descendants advertising
  `channel_reply/v1` are eligible. Discovery rejects duplicate/ineligible chains
  before resolution, so lookup exposes one generic local ineligibility result
  rather than an unreachable special ambiguity message. Stale, replaced, dead,
  old-protocol, or otherwise ineligible targets fail the same way; there is no
  owner-Agent fallback.
- The owner keeps the lossless raw Telegram transport record, then stops before
  conversation preview, Task Card, LICC notification, or owner provider history.
  Exactly one target-local at-most-once LICC task is published for a successful
  route. The target receives a short-lived `channel_reply` capsule and never the
  Telegram Bot token, poller, public Telegram MCP, or owner ChatSession.
- Every owner-derived reply grant and target capsule expires exactly two hours
  after the route's creation time. Grant `created_at` is immutable owner/router
  issuance time and anchors that lifetime. For each concrete `channel_reply`
  submit, the target generates request `created_at` as the current UTC submission
  time; it is not exact owner authority and stale/future request checks still
  apply. `/agent reset` or reselection controls only future message routing: it
  does not retroactively revoke or erase a grant already delivered to a target,
  which may still submit its one reply until consumed, revoked by terminal
  failure, or expired.
- A target reply can use the capsule once. Immediately before the persisted
  sending barrier and again before the Telegram call, the owner revalidates the
  exact target identity, ledger chain, manifest, protocol, and live presence.
  Stale queued replies fail terminally without a Telegram call, and stale cached
  adapters are retired. The owner derives the account, chat, and original
  message anchor; deleted or unreplyable anchors fail terminally rather than
  sending an unanchored fallback.
- V1 accepts only ordinary non-empty text in admitted private human chats.
  Groups, channels, topics, media/captions, current or legacy forwarded messages,
  service events, and rich/media replies are not routed. When a saved target or
  one-shot directive applies, unsupported content receives a local error and
  wakes neither target nor owner. With neither selection nor switching directive,
  ordinary admin behavior remains unchanged.
- V1 never routes an edited message. After the lossless raw edit is durable, an
  admitted private-human edit is switching-owned when its text is selector- or
  `/agent`-directive-like under the existing parser/username rules, a saved
  selection is valid, selection state is unavailable, or `original-ownership`
  proves that exact original account/chat/user/message identity was routed within
  the seven-day horizon. It receives one generic local unsupported-content error
  anchored to the edited Telegram message and stops before owner preview, Task
  Card, notification, LICC, history, provider state, or any target publication.
  A strict body-free `edit-rejections/<digest>.json` decision makes replay of the
  same Telegram update local-reply idempotent across restart; unavailable decision
  state remains handled and may stay silent rather than risk a duplicate error.
  Reset or reselection changes only future new-message routing: it cannot
  declassify or reassign a marked original. With no selection, directive-like
  text, unavailable state, or live prior marker, ordinary admin edit behavior
  remains unchanged.
- Definite pre-publication failures get a generic local error. After a publication
  boundary, delivery may be indeterminate; V1 never retries or remints and may stay
  silent rather than claim success or failure that it cannot prove. Repeating the
  same Telegram update does not republish the target task.
- Before creating any target-visible capsule, router decision, or inbox event for
  a newly routed original, the owner commits a strict versioned private atomic and
  fsynced `state/original-ownership/<digest>.json` marker. Its filename/key is an
  opaque digest of the exact account/chat/user/message identity; the record stores
  only that digest plus creation/expiry times, never a routed/edited body, Telegram
  username, selector, or other human content. Missing markers are created once,
  exact duplicates reuse the same truth, and malformed, unreadable, conflicting,
  or inaccessible occupants fail closed before any target task.
- A dedicated worker runs retention immediately after startup and then every five
  minutes using a monotonic cadence. Each cycle inspects at most 128 total picker,
  raw-quarantine, original-ownership, and edit-rejection items and at most 128 currently registered
  target reply roots; one surface failure is isolated from all others and from
  poll/reply drains. Expired picker records are removed, raw quarantine and valid
  original-ownership markers and edit-rejection decisions are retained seven days,
  and Core grant/request/target reply state uses its seven-day retention rules.
  Menu/dead/original-ownership/edit-rejection discovery and target rotation are
  truly paginated with durable native cursors, not whole-directory scans.
  All four owner classes rotate fairly across restart.
  Unsafe or malformed ownership evidence is preserved rather than deleted into an
  apparent admin absence. Core separately persists fair cleanup class and scan
  progress, so sustained claims and process restart cannot starve receipts,
  consumed/dead state, capsules, or temp reconciliation. Tiny
  selection-unavailable tombstones remain until reset/reselection. Proof-free
  owner Core no-remint decisions and Telegram target router decisions are retained
  permanently, including terminal/ambiguous truth; cleanup never authorizes a
  remint, republish, or ambiguous-delivery retry.

The paired packaged state/writer details are in
`reference/agent-switching/CONTRACT.md` and
`reference/agent-switching/ANATOMY.md`.

This is a cooperative same-UID boundary, not hostile process isolation: sibling
Agents sharing the same OS account can ultimately read one another's files.
Strict owner/target state, single-use grants, no-symlink checks, and target-only
projection prevent accidental authority sharing and cross-Agent conversation
leaks within that deployment model.

## AUTOMATIC TASK CARD: `events.jsonl` → resident broadcast

The automatic slot is a bounded projection of the agent's durable behavior
journal, and it feeds the same shared `TaskCardResident` state machine as the
programmable slot. Telegram supplies the provider transport and persistence
adapter:

1. `TelegramManager` owns one tail worker for its lifetime and reads
   `<workdir>/logs/events.jsonl`. The transport-free
   `TaskCardEventProjection` core accepts only canonical public `diary` text
   plus validated `tool_call` name and redacted/bounded `_reasoning`. Hidden
   thinking, aliases, raw action/arguments/results, external response bodies,
   URLs, tokens, prompts, paths, tracebacks, auth material, and private runtime
   diagnostics are never projected. `tool_result`, completion, elapsed,
   heartbeat, API-error, and provider-error rows are not rendered either.
2. A provider/API call is identified by its `api_call_id`. All public text and
   safe tool events with the same id remain in one atomic group. The card emits
   exactly one TUI-style divider (`──────────`) before each selected group;
   multiple text/tool events do not create extra dividers.
3. `/taskcard N` selects the latest N API-call groups (1–10), not N tool uses.
   The existing persisted `normal_rows` value is reused as this numeric group
   window. If a selected group is larger than the card budget, content is
   truncated inside that group after the group count has been chosen.
4. Each rendered card carries the safe public text and tool rows, the fixed
   no-reply footer naming both `/taskcard` command forms, and the render-time
   timestamp.
5. The shared core renders the bounded groups once; the manager broadcasts that
   same agent-behavior view to every tracked resident Task Card across configured
   Telegram accounts and chats. The shared projection contains no journal I/O,
   account/chat route, resident state, or transport. Groups are not correlated
   to the chat that created a resident card; one target's failure does not block
   the others.
6. There is no durable cursor or second behavior store. The byte offset, groups,
   and channel frames are in-memory optimizations. Startup, refresh, molt, and
   detected log truncation/replacement rehydrate from the existing
   `events.jsonl` and `TelegramAccount.task_cards` state. An unterminated final
   JSONL line is left unconsumed until complete, and read/stat failures fail
   closed rather than advancing past unseen bytes.

Architecture and lifecycle details live in the owning
[`mcp_servers` Anatomy](../ANATOMY.md). The pure event grouping/redaction/render
core is [`task_card/event_projection.py`](../task_card/event_projection.py).
The route/slot/rotation/failure state machine is
[`task_card/resident.py`](../task_card/resident.py); Telegram still owns journal
tailing and implements the real edit/delete/send/persist callbacks. The local
[`telegram/task_card/resident.py`](task_card/resident.py) path is a compatibility
re-export. The programmable renderer/tool structure lives in the separate
[`telegram/task_card` Anatomy](task_card/ANATOMY.md).

### Resident-card behavior you can rely on

Both slots share one per-account+chat delivery transaction over a single tracked
resident target. The provider-neutral resident core serializes and commits slot
state only after success; Telegram callbacks classify the real API outcomes.
While that resident is still the chat's last message it is edited in place (an
identical Telegram edit is a successful no-op). Once a newer message sits below
it — your own durable send/reply, or an incoming user message — the shared state
machine replaces it old-first and fails closed: the exact old card must be
confirmed deleted, or Telegram must explicitly report it already missing, before a
replacement is sent, so rotation never deliberately shows two cards. A replacement
that then fails may leave **zero** cards and says so explicitly; a durable-id write
failure surfaces as a partial, not as success. Ordinary messages are never deletion
candidates and unknown historical orphan cards are never scanned or deleted; the
durable map is one tracked target per account+chat, not proof of global
chat-history cardinality. Normative source:
[`task_card/CONTRACT.md`](task_card/CONTRACT.md) §Behavior 7–8.

## TASKCARD STATE

- `/taskcard` reports both current preferences. `/taskcard on` and `/taskcard off`
  change delivery locally without an LLM call. `/taskcard N` sets the rolling
  API-call-group window to decimal `N=1..10` without changing delivery; invalid,
  non-ASCII, extra-argument, and out-of-range forms return usage rather than being
  clamped. Telegram's normal `/taskcard@BotName ...` mention form works in groups.
- The preferences are agent-wide and shared by all configured Telegram accounts
  and chats. They persist across refresh/restart in
  `<workdir>/telegram/taskcard.json` as `{"taskcard": bool, "normal_rows": N}`;
  legacy boolean-only files remain valid and default `normal_rows` to 1. Writes
  are atomic + fsynced, and memory changes only after durable write success.
- Every Telegram message representation shown to the agent carries the current
  delivery boolean: structured message objects use `taskcard: true|false`, and
  textual preview lines use `taskcard: True|False`. Check/read/search items derive
  it at projection time, so old stored messages reflect the current value without
  history rewrites. `normal_rows` is the compatibility persistence key for how
  many of the newest bounded API-call groups the automatic card renders; it is
  not a tool-row count.
- `taskcard: True` means automatic and programmable Task Cards may be sent to
  Telegram. **`taskcard: False` / `/taskcard off` hides delivery of *both* slots**
  at the presentation boundary while every mechanic continues — the event tail
  still follows the journal, and programmable renderers, watches, retries, and
  bookkeeping keep running. Nothing is broadcast while disabled. Turning delivery
  back on needs no restart.
- When answering whether Task Cards are on or how many normal rows they keep, use
  the explicit current `/taskcard` status rather than inferring from a visible card.

## PROGRAMMABLE TASK CARD (`task_card` intrinsic tool)

- The public model-facing `task_card` capability is intrinsic and
  channel-neutral. Read the canonical producer manual at
  [`../../tools/task_card/manual/SKILL.md`](../../tools/task_card/manual/SKILL.md)
  before authoring a watcher. Telegram does not own that tool, does not run
  renderers, and does not accept Task Card JSON/controller instructions.
- Use a Python renderer file inside the agent working directory. Each successful
  run must exit `0` and print a nonempty full Markdown/text body to stdout. The
  intrinsic producer writes that body atomically to
  `<workdir>/taskcard/taskcard.md`, then writes exact `active` to
  `<workdir>/taskcard/status`. `stop` and agent shutdown write exact `inactive`;
  the last body remains on disk.
- Actions are `start | inspect | retry | stop | remove | manual`. `start`
  performs the first render synchronously and starts no watch on failure.
  `retry` updates only the body for the active watch. `stop` deactivates the
  intrinsic artifact while preserving its body; `remove` is terminal cleanup
  that retires the watch and deletes the body. One intrinsic-owned watch may be
  active per agent.
- Telegram owns the resident message, automatic/mechanical event-journal slot,
  composition, persistence, and message updates. It reads
  `taskcard/status` and `taskcard/taskcard.md` only for the agent-owned
  programmable frame: exact `active` plus a nonempty body includes or updates
  `— TASK CARD —`; exact `inactive` idempotently excludes only that programmable
  frame while preserving the resident, automatic content, and local body.
  Missing/unreadable/other status, active with a missing/blank body, or
  unchanged bytes remain a no-op at the Telegram boundary.
- Skipping unchanged bytes is not a rate-limit exemption. Every time your
  renderer's output actually changes, Telegram performs a real message
  edit/send, subject to the same Bot API flood-control limits as any other
  send (see [`reference/rate-limits/SKILL.md`](reference/rate-limits/SKILL.md)).
  A renderer that churns its body on every tick can hit HTTP 429 exactly like
  frequent manual sends, even though a producer with unchanged output would
  cause zero Telegram traffic. Choose `interval_s` and how often your output
  actually changes deliberately — cadence and churn are a product choice, not
  something the diff-only skip makes safe by default.

## ERROR SURFACING

- Actions return `{'status': ...}` on success or `{'error': <message>}` on
  failure (e.g. missing `chat_id`, unreadable `media.path`, bad `rendering_mode`).
  Check for the `'error'` key and surface or act on it rather than assuming the
  message was delivered.
- Telegram HTTP 429 responses fail fast with `status: 'error'`,
  `error_code: 429`, and `auto_retry: false`. A valid provider `retry_after`
  makes `retryable: true`: wait at least that many seconds before starting a new
  action. Without valid cooldown metadata, both `retryable` and `retry_after`
  are omitted rather than guessed. The addon never sleeps inside a
  tool call or schedules a hidden second side effect.
- Read [`reference/rate-limits/SKILL.md`](reference/rate-limits/SKILL.md) for
  Telegram's currently documented quotas, official source links, and the
  distinction between provider facts and product policy before changing message
  or programmable Task Card cadence.
- The hosted Telegram Bot API limits `getFile` downloads to 20 MB. If an inbound
  document cannot be downloaded, `read` retains its available Telegram metadata
  without a local path, adds a safe bounded provider reason in `download_error`,
  and includes actionable resend/alternate-transfer guidance in the message text.
  For the hosted size error, ask for parts no larger than 20 MB or another transfer
  method. No reply is sent to the Telegram user automatically.
- Telegram's upstream local Bot API server can download files without that limit,
  but this addon currently uses the official hosted endpoints and does not expose
  local-server configuration or support.
- A duplicate identical send returns `{'status': 'blocked'}`; treat that as
  'already sent', not as a transient error to retry.

## PUBLIC TOOL FAMILY: strict LTP-v2

Raw MCP discovery exposes exactly one public tool: `telegram`. It is a strict
LTP-v2 family with the closed root `{action, input, reasoning, summarize?}`
(`action`, `input`, and `reasoning` required) and a closed action-owned input
branch. `telegram` actions are exactly `send`, `check`, `read`, `reply`,
`search`, `delete`, `edit`, `contacts`, `add_contact`, `remove_contact`,
`accounts`, and `manual`. The family-owned `manual` action is the discovery path
for these packaged docs. Do not use the retired flat/legacy shape, `_reasoning`,
aliases, or a generic dispatcher.

The public `task_card` tool is now intrinsic (`lingtai.tools.task_card`) and
produces `<workdir>/taskcard/status` plus `<workdir>/taskcard/taskcard.md`.
Telegram only projects that artifact read-only into its resident Task Card. For
Telegram projection details, read [`task_card/SKILL.md`](task_card/SKILL.md).
