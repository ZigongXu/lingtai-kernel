"""Built-in tool registry — the composition seam owned by ``lingtai.tools``.

This is the tools' own catalog data plus the composition helpers that boot them
onto an agent. It owns two layers:

- :data:`INTRINSICS` — the mandatory-intrinsics mapping injected into
  ``BaseAgent(intrinsics=...)`` (the kernel reads it from ``lingtai.tools.registry``).
- the dynamic-capability registry: :data:`BUILTIN_TOOLS` (capability name →
  ``lingtai.tools.<pkg>`` module path), :data:`CORE_DEFAULTS`,
  :func:`setup_capability`, :func:`apply_core_defaults`,
  :func:`normalize_capabilities`,
  :func:`get_all_providers`, :data:`CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE`.

Import discipline: capability modules are resolved with ``importlib`` *inside*
:func:`setup_capability` / :func:`get_all_providers`, never at module top, so
``import lingtai.tools.registry`` does not eagerly import every tool (and, for the two
capability tools that lazily import ``lingtai`` services, does not pull
``lingtai``). The intrinsic modules ARE imported statically below because
they are mandatory and cheap; they live under ``lingtai.tools`` and import only
``lingtai.kernel``.

# duck-typed intrinsic protocol: ``get_schema(lang)``, ``get_description(lang)``,
# ``handle(agent, args)``, and optionally ``boot(agent)``. ``BaseAgent`` iterates
# this mapping in ``_wire_intrinsics``; membership here is the mandatory-include

# ``psyche`` is the single model-visible root for the four durable domains:
# ``pad + lingtai + knowledge + skills = psyche``. It replaced the four former
# public roots as a clean break: those tool names are unknown and fail loudly,
# and there is no alias for any of them or for the retired ``pad.append`` /
# ``skills.info`` / ``knowledge.info`` actions.
#
# The root name was previously used by a different family (``lingtai_update``,
# ``pad_edit``, ``context_molt``, ``name_set``, ...). Reusing the name grants
# none of those actions: they were dissolved into ``context`` and ``system``
# and are not aliases here. The current family's only actions are five
# strict-empty manual loaders. Root reuse is not action compatibility.
#
# The four domain packages still exist — but as PRIVATE owners only.
# ``pad``/``lingtai`` keep their canonical prompt composers and no longer define
# ``boot()``; ``psyche.boot`` invokes those composers instead, since the
# kernel's boot loop only reaches registered intrinsics.
# ``knowledge``/``skills`` keep their capability ``setup()``, catalog
# composition, configured paths, and one-time legacy migration. None of them
# registers a public tool, and none is imported at this seam any more.
#
# ``context`` is the department that owns the agent's context (molt, summarize,
# rebuild). It absorbed the OLD ``psyche`` family's lifecycle actions, whose
# remaining name actions moved to ``system``; no old ``psyche`` action is
# reachable on the current root of that name.
