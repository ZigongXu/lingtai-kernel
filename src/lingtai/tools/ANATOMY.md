  Keep this registry Anatomy connected to its parent and the unified web owner.
  Browser is an internal browse child, not a second public capability. The
  generic tool_family package is optional composition infrastructure any
  future family migration may adopt, not a second registry. context is its
  thirteenth consumer and the fifth migrated intrinsic. Update
  structural claims with code and keep reciprocal graph edges valid.
  Capability mentions in any document require explicit bidirectional
  related_files mapping to the implementing code (see root ## Maintenance).

# src/lingtai/tools/

This package owns concrete built-in tools and the registry that composes them
onto an Agent. The kernel owns generic tool machinery; this layer owns public
capability names and lazy adapters.

## Components

- `CONTRACT.md` — the LingTai Tool Protocol (LTP): the future canonical
  model-facing tool call contract, the two-level family/action settings
  addressing and ownership rules, and the explicit per-tool migration boundary.
- `channel_reply/` — mandatory static, normally unauthorized reply intrinsic.
  Active target-file composition for an ordinary Agent is macOS only;
  unsupported platforms keep a reason-bearing local closed Port and no route
  marker. An owner capsule enables only tuple-safe local queue/receipt transport.
  The Core Port accepts
  opaque grant, request id, timestamp, bounded plain text, and proof; owner
  adapters derive concrete destinations from grant state
  (`src/lingtai/tools/channel_reply/ANATOMY.md`).
- `registry.py` — intrinsic mapping, public `BUILTIN_TOOLS`, input aliases,
  defaults, normalization, setup, and check-caps metadata
  (`src/lingtai/tools/registry.py:39-344`).
- `web_search/` — public `web` composition owner for search, browse, settings,
  and manual (`src/lingtai/tools/web_search/ANATOMY.md`).
- `task_card/` — intrinsic channel-neutral declarative Task Card producer: one
  public `task_card` family, one agent-local artifact under `taskcard/`, and
  no transport ownership (`src/lingtai/tools/task_card/ANATOMY.md`).
- `file/` — sole owner of the public `file` capability: the composed schema,
  the envelope dispatch, and all five operation implementations in
  `_read.py`/`_write.py`/`_edit.py`/`_glob.py`/`_grep.py`
  (`src/lingtai/tools/file/ANATOMY.md`).
- `vision/` — public `vision` composition owner: one action-separated family
  with canonical `analyze`/`manual` children over the existing direct
  provider routing (`src/lingtai/tools/vision/ANATOMY.md`).
- `browser/` — internal static browse Core/Port used by `web`
  (`src/lingtai/tools/browser/ANATOMY.md`).
- `tool_family/` — generic, optional ToolFamily/ChildTool schema-composition
  and dispatch infrastructure implementing the LTP v2 envelope, and the
  reusable ManualTool builder; `web` is its first real consumer, `mcp` its
  second, `knowledge` its third, `file` its fourth, `vision` its fifth,
  `avatar` its sixth, `soul` its seventh, `shell` its eighth, `skills` its
  ninth, `notification` its tenth, `system` its eleventh, `daemon` its
  twelfth, `context` its thirteenth, and `plugin` its fourteenth
  (`src/lingtai/tools/tool_family/ANATOMY.md`).
  <!-- LTP_V2_CURRENT_FAMILIES: web,mcp,plugin,file,vision,avatar,soul,shell,notification,system,daemon,email,task_card,channel_reply,context,psyche -->
- `plugin/` — the `plugin` capability: the per-agent Agent Plugins
  (agent-plugins.org, v1.0.0) catalog and registration snapshot, structural twin
  of `mcp` with the same `info`/`manual` children and the same tool/service split
  (`src/lingtai/tools/plugin/ANATOMY.md`, `src/lingtai/tools/plugin/CONTRACT.md`).
  A plugin *declared* in `init.json` `manifest.plugins` is mounted at boot — its
  `skills/` composed into the skills catalog, its `mcp.json` servers registered
  in `mcp_registry.jsonl` with `source="plugin:<name>"` — while one merely
  *discovered* on an inherited skills path is listed and nothing more. The tool
  itself stays read-only: mounting happens in
  `Agent._register_declared_plugins` before capability setup, unreachable from
  any action, which is what makes it safe in `CORE_DEFAULTS`. Registration is
  registry-level like `addons:[]`: registered, never running.
- `system/` — mandatory intrinsic owning the public `system` family: runtime,
  lifecycle, preset, and identity-naming actions behind one model-facing root
  (`src/lingtai/tools/system/ANATOMY.md`). It owns no public context-hygiene
  action — `summarize.py` stays here as the private engine `context` drives. Like `soul` and `notification` it is
  an intrinsic rather than a manager-owning capability, so it composes its
  schema from a module-level schema-only family and builds a dispatching one
  per `handle(agent, args)` call.
- `knowledge/` — private durable knowledge catalog, migrated to the LTP v2
  family envelope with the unchanged public actions `info`/`manual`
  (`src/lingtai/tools/knowledge/ANATOMY.md`).
- `soul/` — the `soul` intrinsic family: six action-separated children
  (`inquiry`, `flow`, `config`, `voice`, `dismiss`, `manual`) behind one
  model-facing root (`src/lingtai/tools/soul/ANATOMY.md`).
- `bash/` — public `shell` composition owner for run/poll/cancel/manual
  (`src/lingtai/tools/bash/ANATOMY.md`); the public model-facing schema is
  the ToolFamily-composed LTP v2 envelope (`bash/_tool_family.py`) and is the
  package's only schema/description pair, while `ShellManager` remains the
  unchanged execution engine behind an internal-only flat call shape.
- `notification/` — mandatory intrinsic owning the public `notification`
  family: `check`, three atomic dismiss actions, and `manual`
  (`src/lingtai/tools/notification/ANATOMY.md`). Its public model-facing schema
  is the ToolFamily-composed LTP v2 envelope; unlike the capability families it
  builds its dispatching family per call, because an intrinsic receives `agent`
  per call rather than owning a manager.
- `context/` — mandatory intrinsic owning the public `context` family: the
  agent's context lifecycle and hygiene — `molt`, `summarize`, `rebuild`, and
  `manual` — behind one root (`src/lingtai/tools/context/ANATOMY.md`). It
  replaces the former `psyche` root, which no longer exists at any
  model-visible or registry level: the two name actions moved to `system` and
  the public `system` summarize action moved in. `summarize` records only;
  `rebuild` is the sole active full reconstruction: canonical prompt composition,
  summary application, then provider replay. Refresh/molt invoke the same
  internal contract passively. Like `soul`/`notification` it builds its family
  per call and alone consumes kernel `_tc_id`.
- `pad/` — mandatory `append | manual` family. `append` validates/persists pinned
  references without hot-loading; private `_pad_load` participates only in the
  Agent's canonical reconstruction path (`src/lingtai/tools/pad/ANATOMY.md`).
- `lingtai/` — mandatory manual-only identity signpost. Private
  `_lingtai_load` composes character during canonical reconstruction; generic
  durable mutation is owned by `file` (`src/lingtai/tools/lingtai/ANATOMY.md`).
- `email/` — the filesystem-based `email` intrinsic: mailbox I/O, composition,
  search, contacts, and delivery, migrated to the LTP v2 family envelope
  (`src/lingtai/tools/email/ANATOMY.md`).
- `_manual.py` — bounded installed-manual loader
  (`src/lingtai/tools/_manual.py:1-29`).
- `__init__.py` — the package docstring that fixes the flat one-directory-per-tool
  layout and the `lingtai → lingtai.tools → lingtai.kernel` import DAG enforced by
  `tests/test_kernel_isolation.py` (`src/lingtai/tools/__init__.py:1-12`).
- `i18n/` — the tool locale catalog (`en`/`zh`/`wen`) holding the *human-facing
  manager prose* concrete tools resolve through `lingtai.kernel.i18n.t(lang, key)`
  (`soul.system_prompt`, `knowledge.preamble`, `email.unread_digest`, …). It owns
  no model-facing schema or description text: that lives in canonical English tool
  source plus the per-package `glossary-{en,zh,wen}.md` resources
  (`src/lingtai/tools/i18n/__init__.py:1-14`).

## Connections

`Agent` calls registry setup. The public `web` row imports
`lingtai.tools.web_search` lazily. That owner imports the browser Core and
provider factory only at composition or action boundaries, and imports
`tool_family` to compose its schema and (optionally) dispatch. The public
`vision` row imports `lingtai.tools.vision`, which imports `tool_family` the
same way and reaches `lingtai.services.vision` only on the selected direct
route. The pinned browser transport remains an outer adapter. `web_search` is
accepted only as a one-way configuration input alias and is never emitted as a
public name. `soul` is a mandatory intrinsic (`INTRINSICS`, not
`BUILTIN_TOOLS`) and imports `tool_family` statically; because it is a module
rather than a per-Agent manager object, it composes its schema from a
module-level schema-only `ToolFamily` and builds an agent-bound one per
`handle(agent, args)` call. The public `shell` row imports `lingtai.tools.bash`
lazily; `bash/__init__.py` imports `tool_family` (via `bash/_tool_family.py`)
to compose the public action-separated schema (re-exported as the package's
canonical `get_schema`/`get_description`) and to translate `action`/`input`
calls into the internal flat shape `ShellManager.handle` consumes. `bash` is
the one-way legacy input alias for `shell` (`registry.py`) and is never
emitted as a public name or a second schema.

The public `file` row imports `lingtai.tools.file` lazily; that owner binds its
five operation modules once per manager and reaches the working tree only
through the injected `FileIOService`. Unlike `bash`/`web_search`, the file
migration kept no configuration aliases: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `glob`, and
`grep` are unknown capability names that fail loudly. Capability groups no
longer exist at all — `file` was `_GROUPS`' only entry, so the map,
`expand_groups`, and every consumer were deleted rather than left empty.

The public `task_card` row imports `lingtai.tools.task_card` lazily and owns
the artifact writer entirely within `lingtai.tools`. It writes only
`taskcard/status` and `taskcard/taskcard.md`; consumer-specific reading,
polling, and projection stay outside this package.

## Composition

The parent [`src/lingtai/ANATOMY.md`](../ANATOMY.md) owns Agent composition.
The paired tools Contract owns LTP: the future canonical `action` / `input` /
`reasoning` / `summarize` public call shape, family/action settings ownership,
and the migration boundary. Read it there; this Anatomy does not restate those
promises. The web Contract specializes
that promise for the first real implementation; its Anatomy and the internal
browser Anatomy provide progressive disclosure. Other tool packages retain their
existing public shapes until explicitly migrated.

## State

No mutable state lives at package root. `WebManager` owns per-Agent engine
specs, lazy provider cache, BrowserEngine refs/snapshots/cursors, and settings
observations. No process-global environment mutation or cross-Agent state is
owned here.

## Notes

Retained physical legacy directories (`bash/`, `web_search/`) and
provider-native wire strings remain for compatibility. They must not become
registry, schema, prompt, check-caps, manual, or catalog entries under those old
public names. The five pre-migration file packages are not among them: they were
deleted outright into `file/`, so there is no legacy directory, contract,
glossary, or alias left for that surface.
