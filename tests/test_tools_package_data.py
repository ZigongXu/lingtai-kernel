"""Regression test: built wheels must ship every built-in tool contract.

The consolidated ``lingtai.tools`` package ships its shared ``CONTRACT.md``,
one ``CONTRACT.md`` per built-in tool, and the daemon's intentional interactive-
terminal component contract, alongside its manual trees.
These reach the wheel only through the ``"lingtai.tools"`` entry
in ``[tool.setuptools.package-data]`` in ``pyproject.toml``; a missing glob
silently drops the contract while the tool code still installs (the
consolidation blocker this test guards).

Rather than grepping the config text, this test builds a real wheel and inspects
the distribution manifest at the correct boundary — the archive that pip
actually installs. Both the pure-Python wheel (built here) and the native
sidecar wheel place packages at the archive root (``lingtai/tools/...``): the native
wheel is platlib-compliant, so it does *not* bury packages under
``<name>-<ver>.data/purelib/`` — that placement was the auditwheel release
blocker fixed in ``setup.py`` and is guarded by
``tests/test_wheel_platlib_layout.py``.
